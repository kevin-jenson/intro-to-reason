# Arrays and Lists

- using List sorting functions sort the following list to be unique, reverse it and convert each element to string
  [8, 5, 3, 5, 2, 6, 2, 5, 8, 3, 6, 7]
- then convert previous list to an array and then convert array to list by using ArrayLabels fold_right functions
- recreate List.nth functions

# Functions

- write a function that determines if a word is isogram;
- write a recursive function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.
- write a merge sort algorythm in ReasonML (use you own infex operator for compare function)

# Modules

- Experiment with Js Module (won't run in rtop. will run only in env with bucklescript)
- create binary search tree module for creating data structure as well as with insert and remove functions
- create priority queue module
